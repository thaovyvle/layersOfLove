# Project Task:

Design a single-page website that demonstrates creativity. It should be a responsive site that works on at least 3 screen sizes. Website will include:

• HTML content that displays your creativity 

• CSS styling appropriate for the content

• Appropriate use of grid and media queries to adjust the page as the width changes

​

# My Approach:

The creative endeavor I chose for my single-page website is cake design. Using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I developed a website that seamlessly adapts to three distinct screen sizes. Grids and media queries were utilized for the different layouts throughout the page. Additionally, I designed the site's logo and incorporated relevant content from the internet.
